Description: Linear factor model fitting for asset returns (three major types-
    time series, fundamental and statistical factor models); related risk
    (volatility, VaR and ES) and performance attribution (factor-contributed vs
    idiosyncratic returns); tabular displays of risk and performance reports;
    factor model Monte Carlo, single and multiple imputation methods for simulating 
    returns and backfilling unequal histories.
  	S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE has kindly provided firm fundamentals data 
  	referred to as scores or alpha factors for educational use in the open source 
  	FactoAnalytics R package. The data is contained in the R dataframe object 
  	factorDataSPGMI	consisting of the following cross-section of scores for 
  	approximately 300 stocks from 1990 to 2015: AccrualRatioCF, AnnVol12M, Beta60M, BP, Chg1YEPS, DivP, EBITDAEV, EP, EQ-style,	LogMktCap, PM12M1M, ROE. 
  	This data greatly facilitates the educational value to users of the fundamental factor model in FactoAnalytics.
